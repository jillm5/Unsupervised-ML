COMPARING LONDON AND NEW YORK USING FOURSQUARE VENUE DATA: DIVERSITY AND PRESENCE OF PARKS

PROBLEM DEFINITION
Compare London and New York neighborhoods in terms of : 
- homogeneity - how homogenious or diverse the segments are in these two cities
- the importance of parks, which city has more segments where parks are feautured 
   more prominantly by being present in more clusters and in higher positions

DATA SOURCE
Pull postal code and borough information for both cities using Wiki pages: 
 - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_postal_district
 - https://cocl.us/new_york_dataset
Use Foursquare to pull the top 10 venues against each neighbourhoods
Data processing and exploration involved:
- obtaining the tables form the urls using beautifulsoup
- cleaning the data and transforming the format of the columns, specifically casting Longitude and Latitude into floats
- matching FourSquare data to each neighborhoods to obtain list of venues in the radius of 500 meters
- generating maps with location of the neighborhoods for each city

METHODOLOGY
Use optimisation based on cost function to find optimal number of kclusters for London and New York to see which city has naturally higher number of clusters. 
This is a proxy how homogenious the Neighborhoods are in London and New York. City with highest optimal number of clusters will be 
be considered as more diverse in terms of venue category and location.

Analysing resultant clusters for number of types Parks comes in top positions and producing aggregated 
comparison tables across top 5 locations for both cities

These counts were considered to understand which city has parks being more prominantly feautured in the clusters by venue categories. 
This will prove which city is more 'green'.

RESULTS
Homogeneity
   New York ended up having higher number of possible clusters compared to London: 17 vs. 10. Also the cost for kclustering was much 
   higher for New York indicating that the model found it more difficult to find the common centroids for clusters wich lowest cost.

      In terms of presence of parks, the values for each of the venue rank was calculated, the total number of incidence of each venue 
      calcualted and percentage presence of a specific venue in a total number derived. Even though, Park is listed in position 4 
      in terms of occurance for London, and only on the 10th place for New York, when it comes to the share of venue presence,
      it is listed 3% of the times in top 5 venues for New York compared to 1.9% for London. This indicates that parks are more popular
      venues in New York compared to London. It's interesting to note that Pubs feautre very prominently in London, and absent in NY 
      top 5 listing. While Italian food places are in top 2 positions for NY, they are in top 10 venue categories for London.

   CONCLUSION
   Excercise has brought to attention interesting results: 
   - that NY is more diverse in terms of neighbourhood venue profile. However this might be caused that data had higher number
     of neighborhoods compared to London (301 vs. 32). Analysis might need to be done at a lower level for London - at district levels.
   - the results might be also driven by level of participation among locals with Foursquare, which might be more popular with 
      New Yorkers compared to Londoners
    - Nonetheless it was interesting to observe intrinsic cultural differences between two cities - the ranking of the venues, 
     presence of some venues which are absent in another city
     - the clustering excercise could be potentially improved further, as the optimisation with levels of cost does not provide
      and ultimate answer what is the best number of clusters, the selection is somewhat arbitrary
    - summarising the clustering results yielded interesting results, next steps could be more detailed comparisons and
      creating charts
   
   PRESENTATION FORMAT
   This is best presented as a blogpost, for people who are close to both cities it will be interesting to find out about 
   differences and commonalities in venue preferences among local people of London and New York.
